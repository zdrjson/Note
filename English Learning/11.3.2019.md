Also-ran
Interviewers want to avoid the "also-ran" candidate. An also-ran is a horse that runs in a competition but is not a serious contender. It is just in the race for the sake of it, but not serious about winning or even placing in the top three.
If we are going into an interview half-hearted, the qualities we have talked about won't shine through, and your file will quickly be shuffled mentally into the also-ran category. On the other hand, if you have all of the qualities discussed, you will be worthy of consideration.

Ambition
Some employers are just looking to fill a seat. Data input does't require too much ambition. But if you are applying for a job that requires innovation and risk-taking, you must show you have a keen understanding of the nature of the job and that you are willing to push beyond the present boundaries.Some companies are looking for a candidate who will offer them more than they are asking for.

Creative Ideas
Interviews look for a candidate who can offer some creative idea..
We are trained to answer a question according a standard formula that will satisfy the interviewer. But employers are not looking for more people that think the same. Otherwise, the company falls into a classic paradigm with no dynamic thinkers. Don't guess at an answer or try to offer tame, mind-reading answers. Be adventurous and inspire!
